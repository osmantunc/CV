    <div class="about">
      <p>
        I'm Osman Tunç, a senior Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at TOBB ETÜ. My internship at Fotoniks A.Ş. involved system engineering tasks, while my internships at PulseTRonics focused on electronic warfare and radar systems. In my academic life, I've gained hands-on experience using tools like C, C++, MATLAB, and Verilog. I've also demonstrated strong leadership abilities as Chairman and Vice President of the IEEE TOBB ETÜ Student Branch. My goal is to combine my engineering knowledge with my teamwork and leadership experience to contribute to innovative defense and technology projects.

          I have achieved a significant knowledge base through extensive research in the fields of Electronic Warfare (EW) and Radar. I successfully completed the training provided by my company in these areas. I also read books such as EW Fundamentals, EW 101/102/104, and The Radar Game. Furthermore, I delivered presentations on these topics to my superiors and benefited from the experiences of professionals who have worked or are currently working in leading institutions in these fields within our country.
